## Payment Gateway Integration

This website is a Single Landing page that has an Integrated Payments Gateway to donate money for a good cause.
There is a simple Donate button on the homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment dialog box where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. Once the payment is done, an invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the received payment.
